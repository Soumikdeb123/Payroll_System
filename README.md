## Use Case Description

The Payroll Management System is developed to assist wage managers in efficiently managing employee
compensation, including salaries, wages, tax deductions, and superannuation contributions, while generating
detailed pay slips. The pay slip will be generated in a text file. It will automate payroll processing for full-time, part-
time, and contract workers, accommodating various pay structures based on age and job role.
